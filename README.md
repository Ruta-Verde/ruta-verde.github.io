You may need to create an ssh keypair within github. Requires npm and node version 20.15.0

This uses React and ChakraUI

## Steps

- Pull `git clone git@github.com:Ruta-Verde/ruta-verde.github.io.git`
- Navigate to repo `cd ruta-verde.github.io`
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Run the site locally `npm run dev`
- Check there are no errors before pushing with `npm run build`


## Getting started

First, run the development server:

Open the localhost port provided by Vite on your browser

To refresh the server to see changes, enter:

```bash
